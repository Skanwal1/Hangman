# Hangman

## Description : 
This project is a practical exercise using Python programming. The aim of the project is for the user to guess letters for a hidden word within a certain number of attempts. It has allowed me to apply my learning and test my skills in implementing concepts such as functions, loops, classes and user input handling in VS code.

## Usage instructions
1. Open a terminal of command prompt
2. Navigate to the project directory
3. Run the final finished file - milestone_5
4. Following the instructions that are given : Enter a single letter when prompted in the terminal.
5. Guess the word before all attempts are over.


 ## File structure of the project

Milestone_2 : 
- A list of five favourite fruits is given, and one is chosen at random. 

Milestone_3 : 
- Asks for the users input :
      - Checks if the character is a single alphabetical character
      - Checks if the character is in the random chosen word from the list.
  
Milestone_4 : 
- Asks for the users input as above.
- Checkes the guessed inputs and informs the user with the number of lives/attempts left.
  
Milestone_5 : 
- Again as above asks for the users inpu and checks the guesses.
- Plays the game to see if you have lost or won the game by guessing the word within the given number of attempts.
